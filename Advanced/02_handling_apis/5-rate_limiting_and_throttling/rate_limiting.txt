Rate limiting sets a hard cap on how many requests you're allowed to make in a fixed time window.

âœ… Example:
GitHub API: 60 requests/hour for unauthenticated users.

Twitter API: 900 requests per 15 minutes for a specific endpoint.

If you exceed the limit, you'll get an HTTP error:

429 Too Many Requests
